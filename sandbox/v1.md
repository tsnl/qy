# Qy-2.1 is a programming language for rapid prototyping

## TYPE SYSTEM

### goals

- want to use the same building blocks as C: word datatypes, structs, unions, and pointers.
    - makes FFI easy-- can quickly interop with existing Python and C++ libs.
- want to enable polymorphism via latent typing-- enables run-time type checking
    - this allows type checking to move into run-time code
    - this run-time type-checking can be optimized out later, but it offers flexibility, which is great for prototyping
    - complex type systems can be expressed within the confines of C
- borrow a lot of semantics from Qy family
    - bindings are immutable, like ML need to push memory to mutate

### description

Here is the type lattice-- it is just a tree, where children represent subtypes.

- ints...
    - enums...
- floats...
- each user-defined struct...
- each user-defined union...
- ()*
    - all other data pointer types...
    - function pointers

This is the same as C, and is 100% inter-compatible with C, either via dynamic linking or `libffi`.

### our addition

- We support type inference based on unification.
- We support out-of-order definitions.
- We support **run-time type information for generics**
    - when a parameter receives data of different types, the data is automatically boxed and tagged
    - the 'tag' is an enum of all types in the system, assembled at compile-time
    - **NOTE:** this is typically passed as a separate parameter, i.e. `do_generic_thing(type(v), &v)`
    - **NOTE:** this `type` object allows the runtime to query size, layout, kind, fields, etQy full-fledged reflection.
- (Planned) we offer template polymorphism
- (Planned) we offer a hygienic macro system

**NOTE:** TID/VID system may be incompatible with C names, e.g. Win32 API functions or `size_t`
- these can be 'auto fixed' when we scan headers, e.g. `Size_T` and `createWindow`
    - automatically convert all type names to `UpperCamel_Case`
    - automatically convert first same-case segment (e.g. `LLVMSomethingSomething`) into lowercase 
      (`llvmSomethingSomething`)
- alternatively, can add fixed prefix
  - `C_size_t` and `c_CreateWindow`
  - `Csize_t` and `cCreateWindow`

### drawbacks

- functions are not first class, just like in standard C
    - this may change if trampolines can be used (since compatibility with C is paramount) 
    - note that new Apple Silimake requires a special `jit` endowment to enable trampolines and the ilk.
      They should be OK to add since prototypes typically run on x86 without memory protection
- limited ahead-of-time checking
    - in the future, can maybe perform CFA
- all used data-types must be defined at compile-time
    - try to ameliorate C's header/definition problem by handling definitions out of order
- ~~forward declarations needed, since **compiler is single-pass.**~~
    - declarations still useful to specify types for public functions and bindings, but
    - allow definitions out of order?
    - each pass can be run in parallel

### example

```
def hello (x, y) =>
    pass
```
