- Implemented the ANTLR grammar
- Parsed a sandbox file-- feels really good to use.
- Added `imports` and `params` for top-level modules.
  - note pointers just regular C-level pointers now, need accompanying expressions.

Done:
- Implemented `Table` data-structure: shared by numerous AST nodes of different kinds.
- Implemented some container AST nodes

TODO:
- Implement visitors for elements: convert into AST nodes
- Finish parsing expressions, and then the rest of the grammar
- Write a module called `t` which allows polymorphic type expression and substitution
- Implement typing symbolically, using substitution to implement various rules
  - Two AST passes: handling declaration and handling definition
  - Declarations pass: create contexts containing symbols mapped to types/classes
  - Definitions pass: 
    - create metavariables for types and classes (e.g. type of each expression)
  - Finally, solve type system by elimination.
    - we want to 'eliminate' placeholder metavariables by substituting them with 
      primitive/concrete types and classes.
    - this elimination can be performed through substitution or CHA.
