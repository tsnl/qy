The idea is to create a PL similar to ML / OCaml.
- see: https://ocaml.org/manual/polymorphism.html
- see: https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/modules.html

Add typeclasses LATER, but first support substituting weak type variables for formal template args.
- These weak variables can later be specified using classes in the definition.
- Parametric variables must be declared, just like functions.

Stick to C/Python-style function calls.

Use compilation, but KISS.

```
# Every file is a module. The file may contain submodules.
# Every file must import dependencies from an explicit file path unlike OCaml.

# The 'let' statement is used to bind constants.
# This includes values, Types, CLASSES, and functions().
# It does not admit any type or class specifiers by default.
zero = 0;
fibonacci (x) = {
    if x == 0 or x == 1 {
        x
    } else {
        fibonacci(x-1) + fibonacci(x-2)
    }
};
Int = Int32;
SCALAR (It) = {
    # valid operators: 
    # - ':<' for subtyping, '==' for eq (short-hand)
    # - 'in' for class membership
    # - 'and/or' for conjunction.
    It in S_INTS or
    It in U_INTS or
    It in FLOATS
};

Scalar :: SCALAR;
fibonacci :: Fn (x: Scalar) Scalar;
factorial :: Fn (x: Scalar) Scalar;

# Putting it together:
main :: Fn () Void;

main () = {
    x = 10u;
    y = fibonacci(x);
    z = factorial(x);
    0
};

# Tables encompass structs, tuples, and modules
# Sub-modules are just constant tables
# Types and pointers can be passed in struct values.
# - Since these are constants, they can always be optimized out.

helper = mod {
    Scalar :: SCALAR;
    
    Vector3 :: { 
        x = Scalar(0),
        y = Scalar(0),
        z = Scalar(0)
    }

};

```
