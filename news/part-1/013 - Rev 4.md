## Idea: everything is an OO class

The user can define classes & can inject methods at any time.

There are no namespaces, only data-types with extensions.
- using a single global namespace is possible thanks to highly restrictive `imports` system
- `exposing` can be used to prevent overlap with symbols or address it systematically
- thank you, Rust, for this valuable lesson.

Despite there existing no user namespaces, the compiler manages a different namespace for every type.
- this 'type-namespace' concept is proliferate in JavaScript and TypeScript
- the namespace is assigned to using the `implements` operator, and accessed in 2 ways:
  - via the type, using the `.` operator
  - via instances of the type, using the `:` operator and mandating a function call.
  - via instances of the type statically, using the `.Type.static_member` syntax (TODO)
    - implementing this would let us desugar `:` operations at the parser stage itself!
    - if `C` supports `decltype`, we can surely expose the `Type` via a unique operator (not necessarily `.`)
.
All data-type names may accept formal template arguments, so typing & mod statements must support them
in the left-hand side.

The compiler then turns each type's module into a table that can be validated. Method calls can be desugared in syntax.

```

# Type definitions are strictly restricted to naming data fields 
# and specifying data-types.
# All implementation is separate.
ActorManager[UId] = Structure {
    ActorList = CppVec[ActorManager.ACTOR[UId]];
    
    # values can be typed in a `Structure` type constructor.
    # these become fields.
    # Only in `struct` fields can `mut` occur without an `&` prefix
    # to denote a mutable field.
    all_actors :: mut ActorList;
    
    # types can be bound in other types
    ACTOR[UId] = Interface {
        req uid  :: (Self) -> UId;
        req name :: (Self) -> String;
    };
    
    # values can be bound in other types, in which case
    # they are compile-time constants.
    # pi = compute_pi(1F * 10F^-5F);
    # for now, simpler expressions may be supported.
    pi = 3.14159;
};

# ACTOR[UId] = Interface {
#     # ...
# };

# this is the new 'extends' syntax-- simply inject whatever you want
# into the static namespace using data and bound symbols.
# Implementation is used to provide all function definitions.
# No more modules, because a module is just an object with some methods.
# note: `UId` is a formal & actual template argument, and must share its name with the interface binding.
ActorManager[UId] *= {
    new () = ActorManager {
        ActorList.new()
    };
    
    # note: implementation can be nested!
    # note: if `ACTOR` is moved out of `ActorManager`, this would require the `global` or `nonlocal` keyword.
    ACTOR[UId] *= {
        # note: implementations can be empty, or just have typing info
    };
    
    # note: types cannot be bound in `implements` blocks.
    # this encourages nested type-binding at one site, which is more readable. 
};

# note: implementation can be non-nested too!
# note: there may be multiple formal args at play that need to be checked
# ActorManager.ACTOR[UId] *= {
#     # ...
# };

# aliases can be really convenient
ACTOR[UId] = ActorManager[UId].ACTOR;
