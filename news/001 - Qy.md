Qy (cf Py) is a pared-back version of the Astropod prototype, with an emphasis on being implementable.
It sacrifices runtime-polymorphism, i.e. methods, interfaces, and dynamic dispatch. 
However, it keeps templates.
The end result should be a much nicer version of C with templates.

Template arguments are left unspecified in type by default. In the future, type arguments can be
qualified with type classes.

This language can be blit-ed to C++ (for templates) in a straight-forward way while exporting a C FFI.
However, since it may only consume C-headers, in practice, projects will likely be made of C/C++ wrappers.
The power to import C headers would add a lot, and make allocators 'not our problem' since the user may import from the 
C standard library or another project.
C libraries should be wrapped with a JSON file that specifies arguments for the C++ compiler at the end of the 
toolchain.
Emitting templates ourselves will allow us to lower this implementation to C, LLVM IR, or even assembly without much 
difficulty.

This simplified language structure creates room for SMT-based analysis.

Key ideas of the Astropod prototype:
- VID/TID separation by first letter
    - alter this so if first letter is uppercase, then TID, else VID (so `_` and `_42` are VIDs)
- No variables, only immutable bindings to data: use mutable pointers for mutability
    - cf ML `ref`: makes closures (always by value) pretty trivial
    - change syntax: use `^` for pointer and `^mut` for mutable pointer.
    - use `=` for binding, and `:=` to assign to a pointer LHS (which returns the assigned RHS, so can be chained)
- Always use `(...)` for function calls, but accept a unary argument
    - this helps make function calls explicit
    - while preserving the 'functional' notion of a function call,
    - while letting us curry or not-curry as required
- Use binary `->` operator to declare lambdas
- No submodules: import pulls modules and exposes key symbols, and can import imported module to obtain submodule in 
  effect.
    - remove `exposing` in favor of a future optional `pub` keyword for each module binding.
    - modules may be polymorphic and must be instantiated for each use. 

Amendments:
- Use `&` for logical and, and `|` for logical or.
    - demote bitwise variants to library operations
- Use an `env` module that exports constants whose value changes depending on the platform or interpretation pass.
