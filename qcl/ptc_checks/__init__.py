"""
Post-types-check checks: these checks run on a typed AST to further check program correctness.
    - e.g. checking that data-types are not of infinite size.
    - e.g. checking `const` operator usage is valid
        - need to maintain a table of which expressions are const-computable.
    - e.g. proving `TOT` assignment usage
