(I've recently discovered HVM and want to freeze this until I understand how it works)
-   until then, just keeping C pointers

Departure from reference counting: use BDW GC for optional mark-and-sweep allocation.
-   see: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/performance-garbage-collector.html
-   see: https://www.hboehm.info/gc/faq.html
-   see: https://hboehm.info/gc/
-   can always test against C++ `shared_ptr` in branch, but mark and sweep is much more convenient.
-   BDWGC is _incremental_ and _generational_: two key characteristics that would make it ideal for low-latency applications.
    -   I guess that's the point, huh
    -   I'll have to measure to find out
    -   NOTE: beyond a certain CPU speed, mark and sweep is more efficient.
-   Allows us to keep existing C++ source model without rebuilding everything from scratch.

Departure from custom virtual tables: use custom C++ types, use an FFI to communicate with C++.
-   GC tends to 'infect' C++ application space, but can force custom allocator
-   see: https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/blob/master/doc/README.macros
    -   NOTE: can explicitly call GC_alloc for GC allocations, keep 'malloc' and 'free' optional
    -   NOTE: GC_FULL_FREQ: number of partial collections between full collections
    -   NOTE: POINTER_MASK: can be used to provide tagged pointers
-   downside: lose explicit finalization

IDEA: write a new typer in Rust? Keep remainder in Python.
-   see: http://saidvandeklundert.net/learn/2021-11-18-calling-rust-from-python-using-pyo3/#:~:text=Calling%20Rust%20code%20from%20Python,directly%20as%20a%20Python%20module.
-   if this works well, I can also write a parser in Rust.
-   maybe this is something I can consider after a Python prototype...

IDEA: use HVM as a universal typer?
-   can encode different type theories and let the user extend if they want
-   or, can allow language designers to easily specify type theories via Rust.
