TODO: implement...
-   implement some language-level OOP system
-   allow monotype ARC-ed object instances with DD, so 'reference types'
-   ensure compatible with methods and interfaces
    -   so we support _both_ Rust-style 'struct' and 'impl', as well as
        Java-style 'class' statements.

TODO: write about...
-   different kinds of programs: throwaways, prototypes, production code
-   the inefficiency of small reference types as a warning: OO in the large, not small
