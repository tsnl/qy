# Plan v1

Just trying to understand 'the shape of the problem.'

Challenge is manifestly typing a complex program.
- procedures can be overloaded, are not first-class, and are also type specifiers.
- datatype is not a typeclass-- all qualifiers are type-classes at best.
- data may belong in several classes: we want to construct a hierarchy.

Can output to C (not C++); would need to expand templates ourselves.
