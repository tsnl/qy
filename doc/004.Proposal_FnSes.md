Consider something equivalent to

```
x = (a) => { ... };
y = (b) => mut { ... };
z = (c) => closed { ... };
z = (c) => mut closed { ... };
```

This would allow us to determine and optimize the expected side-effects.
-   'closed' means uses nonlocal values that must be captured (always by 'shallow copy')
-   'mut' means writes to non-local memory
    -   non-local => anywhere on the stack above/before this function's stack frame.

Also, note that
-   every non-closed proc can be mapped to a closed proc
-   mut and immut procs are immutable
-   unless 'mut' is specified, **program can only write to memory on stack.**
    -   must use weakest predicate analysis.
    -   includes contents of argument pointers (weakest predicate => may be called)
