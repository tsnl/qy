The specification becomes perfect by me if we remove typeclasses, instead replacing entirely with traits.
-   `T: Trait` means that 'T' is a type
-   `v: dyn Trait` means that 'v' is a value
-   note that the TID and VID values are OK.

This makes it pretty similar to Rust, which should help popularity.

The removal of typeclasses results in the loss of some expressivity, but there's nothing you can't do, albeit in a more extensible way.
