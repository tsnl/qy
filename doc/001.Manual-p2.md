We can mint/generate new types at compile-time or run-time using a principle called type erasure.

BENEFITS

The idea is this: all type specifiers are either primitive specifiers or 'any' instances with refinements (including ADTs).

We can upcast or downcast object pointers entirely based on information defined at run-time.

Similarly, defining new functions can inhere the required type-checks at run-time when building the function definition-- we need concrete type instances to emit the definition.

DOWNSIDES

Code may be generated by 3rd-party products without us knowing about it: no explicit mechanism to do it all at compile-time.

Additional overhead of runtime type checks/compilation.

Additional complexity of writing a program that generates itself?
