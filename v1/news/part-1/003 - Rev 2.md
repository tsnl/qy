This time, try to type with constructors using a Haskell-like syntax, tables like before.

In this case, upper case IDs are set-specifiers, while lower-case IDs are values.

Upper-case IDs that are defined like functions are actually classes.
- they admit `Type :: CLASS` or `Type1 :< Type2` or `Type1 >: Type2` or `and/or`

Each table statement is either a typing statement or a value binding.
- `module` starts a module, which may have type and class fields, but no mutable fields
- `struct` starts a struct, which can only have value fields, but may have mutable fields (defined using `<-`)

Every type admits an overloaded unary constructor that can be called in value contexts.
- see `Vector3` below
- always identity on elements of own type
- always invoked based on signature...
  - before function body for actual args
  - after function return for return value 

```
# A 'table' initializes many 'elements' in a context-dependent order.
# * in general, table is an associative data structure
# - modules are composed of tables
# - struct initializers are composed of tables
# - chains use a special table subclass, and do not need a keyword prefix.
# - tuples are a special kind of table
demo1 = module {
    fibonacci :: Fn (Number) Number;
    Number    :: NUMBER;        # unless Number = ? in this table, `Number` is generic.

    NUMBER (Number) = {
        Number :: U_INT or
        Number :: S_INT or
        Number :: FLOAT 
    };

    fibonacci (x) = {
        if x == 0 or x == 1 {
            x
        } else {

# chains are an extension of tables which may admit an optional tail.
# - also accepted in chains: 'do ...' element
# - note: '<-' is an expression.
# implicit shadowing is not supported, but can type symbols anywhere in a chain.

    w :: mut Number;

    x = 0;

# pointers:
# - '&' for inout, '^' for out. Pass by value for input.
# - same operators used for types and values.
#   - ANTLR handles this ambiguity without a hitch.
# - all allocations are manually memory managed, BUT
#   - IDEA: tables can easily admit CONSTRUCTORS, DESTRUCTORS for STRUCTs.
#     - move constructor, copy constructor
#     - destructor, consider `delete` operator, and counterpart `new`.
#     - no special `new[]` and `delete[]` because array is just a type, size stored on allocation.
#   - honestly the best solution to MM we know
#   - does not need DD since no inheritance, just composition.
# templates:
# - note slightly modified arg format
# `mut`
# - In the below setup,
#   for v :: Vector,
#   it is possible to update v.slice <- new_slice
#   but not v.slice.data_ptr <- data
